         <h2>A general guide to tournaments. (Written by Ranil)</h2>
      <hr>
</ul><h2><u>Section 1 - Basic Information</u></h2><br><h3>1a - What is a tournament?</h3>On the Overcast Network, a tournament is, just like Project Ares, a team based pvp match where two teams compete for an objective. However, in this case, the teams are decided before hand, matches are organized to be as efficient as possible, and it is watched over by referees. The teams, which are organized and registered for the tournament, fight for an objective and the ability to move on in the bracket. In all past tournaments (1-4) there have been 32 teams organized in a bracket through seeding, meaning that the teams are rated by skill level, and the first seed competes against the 32nd seed in the first round, which makes the best teams have a better chance of making it to the finals. They are played in 5 matches, each eliminating half the teams.<br><h4>Sub 1a - What is a seed?</h4>A seed is a ranking used in determining who faces who in a tournament.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is called a seed because of the analogy with plants where the seed might grow into a top rank at the end of that tournament, or might instead wither away. Players/teams are 'planted' into the&nbsp;bracket&nbsp;in a manner that is typically intended so that the best do not meet until later in the competition. Seedings are determined using a complex system of ranking unknown to players currently (at least to me). Seedings rank from lowest, being 32 in the past, to highest, being 1.<br><br><h3>1b - What is a team? How can I get a team?</h3>A team is a group of players organized prior to the tournament who prepare to compete. Teams can be recognized on the forums with the <b>[Team]</b> tag before the title of a thread (<a href="https://oc.tc/forums/topics/5259c9e2af7fb0f436008fc3">example</a>). In order to become a member of a team, you can either apply on a teams thread if they are open for applications, use an external application which the team has set up (usually a google document), or make a thread with information about yourself and label it with the <b>[LFT]</b> tag, which means Looking for Team (<a href="https://oc.tc/forums/topics/52599951af7fb03f35007693">example</a>). Any interested team will reply to your thread, usually with a link to theirs, and say they are interested in you.<br><br><h3>1c - How do I register my team?</h3>Team registration usually opens up 2 weeks before the actual tournament, and allows players to create teams on a separate page on the website. The first 32 teams to have 6 players confirmed for their team are accepted into the tournament (this is what it has been in the past, it might change for the Fall Tournament). All registered teams are then given a practice server on which they can practice the maps for the tournament, enabling them to try out new strategies and such.<br><br><h2><u>Section 2 - Tournament Play</u></h2><br><h3>2a - How do I access mumble?&nbsp;</h3>In order for your team to compete, you must have at least one team member in mumble an hour before the tournament begins (preferably the captain). Mumble is a voice chat program, similar to Team Speak or Ventrilo, in which players can communicate. A guide on setting up mumble for the Overcast Network server can be found <a href="https://oc.tc/forums/topics/511affcaba608778530001eb">here, </a><a href="https://oc.tc/forums/topics/511affcaba608778530001eb">created by GabeIsAwesome199.</a>&nbsp;Mumble is a necessary part of the tournaments, as it allows the referees to listen in to your chats and make sure you aren't breaking any rules.<br><br><h3>2b - How does a match work?</h3>A few minutes before your match, a referee will enter your mumble channel and give you information on your match, such as the server ip, who you will be facing, etc. Once you are given your IP, you are free to connect to the server. Any issues with connecting should be reported to your referee. Once connected, you will see which map you are playing. A referee will ask one team which color they would like to be, and set the teams accordingly (usually the first team connected gets to choose). If neither team is asked what color, the refs will set them as they please. Once your team is ready, the command /ready will inform the referees that you are. Once both teams are ready, and the referees are ready, a countdown will begin. 
After the countdown, the match will begin. In the past, matches have lasted around 45 minutes at max, with rare extensions allowed. Once one team has completed the objective, they move on, unless it is a best of 3 tournament, in which case the server is set up for the next match. If the match ends in a tie, they usually go to a blitz match, which will determine a winner. Once a team has been eliminated, the winning team moves on in the bracket and the process restarts.<br><br><h3>2c - What happens if I lose?</h3>If you lost a match, there are 2 things that could happen:<br><ol>
<li>In the case of single elimination matches, your team will instantly be eliminated from the tournament. However, if a losers bracket is being held, and you lose on your first match, then your team will be moved to the first matches of the losers bracket. Once you lose there, you're out of the tournament for good.</li>
<li>In the case of triple elimination, the opposing team will gain one point towards progressing. If a team reaches 2 points, meaning they won 2 matches, then they move on to the next round.</li>
</ol><h3>2d - How do I become a referee? What do referees do?</h3>A referee, similar to a moderator on the Overcast Network, is someone who helps make sure everything runs smoothly and nobody breaks any rules. They watch over matches, give information to teams, and help out when needed. They also set up the servers to be ready for the matches. There are 2 types of referee, the Head Ref and the regular ref. The Head Ref has a group of referees who report any happenings to them. The regular ref is the one who does the majority of the server setting up and such. If needed, a Head Ref will take the place of a regular ref.<br>In order to become a referee, you must wait until referee applications are open. Once open, there will be information regarding how to apply, usually by sending in an email to support regarding your application. About a week later, emails are sent out with information about referee training sessions and informing you that you have been accepted. If you were not accepted, no such email will be received. After that, all information will be given to you by tournament organizers and head referees.<br><br><h3>2e - What is a livestreamer? How do I become one?</h3>Livestreamers are the people in charge of streaming the event so players who are not competing can view it. They are broadcasted to whatever website they choose, and also are linked to at <a href="http://oc.tc/live">http://oc.tc/live</a>.<br>In order to become a livestreamer, you go through a similar process as the referees. Livestreamer applications will open up with information regarding how to apply, usually through an email to support. After a bit of time, you will receive a response if accepted as a livestreamer. You get all access to tournament servers, allowing you to stream any match. You also get full access to mumble channels for all teams in case your stream wants to listen in.<br><br><h3>2f - How do I win?</h3>Simple, you reach the final round, which in the past has been the 5th, and beat the enemy team.<br><br><h2><u>Section 3 - Past Tournaments</u></h2><h3>3a - Beta Tournament</h3>Winner: Badlion<br>Teams: <a href="https://oc.tc/forums/topics/50f8bef0f34422ef2e0000bf">Here</a><br>Bracket: Not Available.<br>Gamemode: All<br><br><h3>3b - Attack of the Cores</h3>Winner: Starfish<br>Teams: <a href="https://oc.tc/tournaments/attack-of-the-cores">Here</a><br>Bracket: <a href="http://projectares.challonge.com/attackofthecores">Here</a><br>Gamemode: DTC/DTM<br><br><h3>3c - Raiders of the Lost Wool</h3>Winner: Upper -&nbsp;Starfish &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lower - Tasty Mofo's<br>Teams: <a href="https://oc.tc/tournaments/raiders-of-the-lost-wool">Here</a><br>Bracket: <a href="http://challonge.com/raiders">Upper</a> <a>Lower</a><br>Gamemode: CTW<br><br><h3>3d - Goblet of Gamemodes</h3>Winner: Starfish<br>Teams: <a href="https://oc.tc/tournaments/goblet-of-gamemodes">Here</a><br>Bracket: <a href="http://challonge.com/goblet">Here</a><br>Gamemode: All<br><ul><li><u><b></b></u></li></ul>
