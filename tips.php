              <h2>A general guide to PvP (Written by Oversoul96)</h2>
              <hr>
              <p>If you've played on Project Ares at all, you'll know that there are tons of different strategies you can use in game play. In this guide, Ill talk about some tips and tricks I think will help players become more fit to survive in the PvP onslaught. This guide will focus mainly on DtC maps, because they are the most complex.</p>
              <h4><u>The Basics</u></h4>
              <p>You all know the drill, grab your gear and get into battle. Most of you will be able to skip over this section, as it will be very basic stuff, but lets dive right in anyway.</p>
              <h5>Getting Supplies</h5>
              <p>Hopefully all of you know this by now, but shift clicking items sends them straight into your inventory from chests. If you get to know the contents of each chest, you can grab all of your gear in less than 10 seconds. If you're a victim of TNT bombing rushers, you'll want to get your supplies fast, because sitting at the chests for over a minute will just make you an easy target.</p>
              <p>The things you will most likely want to grab are tools. A pick, sword, axe, and bow should be the first things you grab, along with some building blocks, some TNT, and some arrows. Take some redstone torches or buttons if you want, but you can always make simple wood pressure plates later.</p>
              <p>No matter what you're doing, you're always going to want to have armor in the beginning of the game. Not only will it give you invulnerability to unarmored rushers, but it will also make you more effective in base defense. If you don't grab armor because of cannon construction or bow sniping, you're making a big mistake.</p>
              <h5>TNT</h5>
              <p>This is a huge part of DtC maps. Destroying the other team's supplies will give you a slight advantage in most maps, but setting off TNT will make you a big target for the enemy team. There are three main ways to blow up the enemy base: cannons, direct assault, and bombing.</p>
              <p>Cannons are my personal favorite, though I rarely use them. They are very effective at doing damage when no direct path to the enemy base is available. There are many different cannon designs you can use, some more effective than others in certain situations.</p>
              <p>Direct assault is the most dangerous, but most effective way to destroy vital enemy supplies. Placing giant masses of TNT on the enemy base will do monstrous damage, with a high chance for kills. If you do this, it would help to have armor, or to do this at the very beginning of a match to catch the enemy off guard.</p>
              <p>TNT bombing is the last one on the list, but it is also the most cowardly tactic to use. Using a high vantage point above the enemy base, the player can endlessly rain TNT onto unsuspecting victims. This method of "carpet bombing" is looked down upon by most players of PGM, because most bombers spam TNT for kills. If you want to be a troll, go ahead and rain TNT on the spawn, but prepare to be yelled at.</p>
              <h4><u>Direct Combat</u></h4>
              <p>Anyone can swing a sword in this game, but learning to properly wield it is a different story. First off, let's talk about blocking.</p>
              <h5>Blocking</h5>
              <p> For being a useful mechanic, blocking doesn't get enough love. Blocking can save your life in some events, but using it wrong can also be deadly. Before we get into things, lets make sure we know what blocking does.</p>
              <h6><em>Blocking does</em></h6>
              <p>-Reduce damage taken by melee attacks, arrows, and explosives.</p>
              <h6><em>Blocking does NOT</em></h6>
              <p>-Reduce falling, fire, or suffocation damage.</p>
              <p>The thing you might find yourself blocking most is arrows. Whipping out your sword will magically make you take less damage, and could even save your life. If you're cornered with an enemy pelting you with arrows, blocking would be a good idea. If there is an easy escape, running would obviously be the better choice.</p>
              <p>Getting cornered with TNT in your face is also a good opportunity to block, but if you’re too close, you might just end up getting the floor blown out from underneath you. If youre on a base high in the sky, falling into the void from a TNT explosion would obviously be a bad thing.</p>
              <p>Another important tip for blocking TNT: if you have spare blocks on you, put them between you and the TNT, and you will only take a half heart of damage, no matter how close the explosion may be. If you're facing a monstrous TNT explosion, then the wall will not be very effective. </p>
              <p>Blocking is not very effective in melee combat, as it will make you slow and may even throw off your aim. Alternating between left and right click for your main attack is not something I would recommend, as it will end up doing less damage in the long run.</p>
              <h4><u>Sword Fighting</u></h4>
              <p>There are a number of ways to engage in close-range combat, but a lot of these strategies will be useless if you have a bad connection to the server.</p>
              <h5>Strafing </h5>
              <p>One of the simplest ways to attack is in a circular pattern around your enemy. Rushing straight at your target is not smart. If you want to run straight at your target, you'll want to jump to the side just before you attack. Having the speed boost of sprinting will give you an easier time in battle as well.</p>
              <h5>Jump Crits</h5>
              <p>I don't find these to be very useful, but starting off an attack with a jump can be advantageous. Just don't overdo the jumps, or they will probably throw off your momentum in a battle.</p>
              <h5>Knockback Launch</h5>
              <p>Being one of my favorite things to do, you will need a quick finger to pull this off. After every hit you land on an enemy, quickly double tap the forward key button and hit the enemy again to send him flying double the distance of a normal knockback. If you're really good, you can hit an enemy three times or more. Because of the slight delay you will have before the enemy goes flying, getting multiple strikes should be fairly simple.</p>
              <h5>Chasing</h5>
              <p>When chasing a fleeing enemy, do NOT spam your sword to try and hit him. All this will do is disable your sprint, because Minecraft will think you've struck an enemy while the enemy was actually too far away to take damage. Wait until you're close enough for a guaranteed hit before trying to attack.</p>
              <h5>Things you should not do in a sword fight </h5>
              <p>Running backwards and swinging your sword will let your enemy have an easier time hitting you, while he remains out of your reach (because thats just how this game works). Running away would be a better tactic than swinging while walking backwards.</p>
              <h4><u>Destroy the Core</u></h4>
              <p>Right here is where the fun begins. I will be showing you some of my own tactics, as well as other things I think will help you all for these maps. The main topics I will be discussing are the core, stealth, bridging, and speed. I will also tell you a few tricks for surviving in a losing battle.</p>
              <h5>The Core</h5>
              <p>This is your goal. Leaking lava from the core is simple enough, but we can make it even simpler. Most players see the bottom as the only option available for mining the core, but the most effective place to mine is usually near the top of the core. Look for these weak spots in the core, and you'll be able to destroy it with ease. If the core has water underneath it, you can either lead the lava away from the water, or you can make a small + sign and cut out the center for the lava to leak through.</p>
              <p>If you're not attacking the core, the enemy base, or using a cannon, don't just stand around looking for things to shoot. Take a good look at the core every few seconds to make sure it's safe. Playing without a plan will end up causing you to lose. And if you're trying to look for ways to barricade the core, dont do it. Barricading the core with blocks will make it a lot easier for hidden enemies to mine the core.</p>
              <h5>Stealth</h5>
              <p>Stealth is easily the biggest part of storming an enemy base. Rushing into a bunch of enemies looking for kills will not work. If you have a good vantage point, look for a break in the enemy defense to make your attack. Make sure you're always crouching, too. Don't ever assume that you're perfectly safe, because someone might catch a glimpse of you. Done correctly, you can easily get to your objective without being spotted. </p>
              <p>As for hiding places, creating a box around your self is usually a lot more effective than it sounds. Just don't make it in the middle of the base, or it will look suspicious. Also, remember that you can always make more area for you to walk around on. Dig inside of a wall if you need to, and dig to vulnerable parts of the base through there. You can even line the inside of a base with TNT and ignite it completely undetected. Don't just run across an open field covering the ground with TNT.</p>
              <h5>Bridging</h5>
              <p>Bridging is simple, but if you don't want to die while doing it, there are a few things you can do. </p>
              <p>Quick bridging is, as it sounds, the fastest way to directly bridge to an enemy base, but it also puts you in the most vulnerable position. </p>
              <p>If you take a look at this picture  </p>
              <img src="http://i49.tinypic.com/2a4xod2.png" class="img-rounded">
              <p>While bridging from the red ship to the blue ship, you will want to stand on the side that the green arrow is on, because most archers will be striking you from the left part of the blue ship, sending you to the right. If you're standing on the left, the knockback shouldnt be enough to send you flying off in one hit.</p>
              <p>Making a bridge with rails is slower, but is also safer. Make sure you place the railing blocks before you place the actual bridge, so that youll always have a railing. You shouldn't get knocked backwards toward the void, so making the railing first will give you a better chance to live a shot from an enemy. </p>
              <p>If you want to retreat from a bridge, stay on the side that is opposite from the knockbacks you are receiving, as told before. Also, do NOT jump while sprinting, or the knockback will be greater than usual, and will surely knock you off of a bridge.</p>
              <h5>Speed</h5>
              <p>The last thing I want to talk about, but it is still fairly simple. As all of you should know, jumping while sprinting makes you faster, but another thing I want to talk about is sprint-jump boosting. </p>
              <p>Sprint-jump boosting is an easy way to outrun an enemy in an area that is two blocks high. If you repeatedly jump against the two-high ceiling while sprinting, you can gain a huge speed boost. </p>
              <h5>What to do in a losing battle</h5>
              <p>If you're out of supplies, you might think you're screwed. The first thing you'll want to do is look around your base for any stray items from a dead player. Usually any amount of supplies should be enough to get you back on your feet.</p>
              <p>Out of picks? Grab a TNT. TNT can easily be ignited with a pressure plate, made of only two wood. Place a TNT on one of your diamond or iron patches to get easy access to tools and armor.</p>
              <p>Is there a bridge? Run to the enemy base and steal some supplies from them. If it's late enough in the game for you to be out of supplies, then stealthily taking supplies from the enemy base should be simple while everyone is in disarray.</p>
              <p>The most important thing to do is never give up. You can always come back and win, no matter how bad it gets.</p>

              <h2>Bow Guide (Written by Mdahl)</h2>
              <hr>
              <ol>
                <p>
                <li> <strong> You don't have to pull it back all the way.</strong> Though you deal critical damage by pulling it back all the way, some situations warrant a faster fire rate simply to keep your opponent knocked back and at a distance. It's a good idea to simply spam arrows at a charging enemy wielding a sword to hold him in place until you feel it's safe to deal a finishing blow. </li>
                </p>
                <p>
                <li><strong>Walls don't always help.</strong> It seems counterintuitive, but walls with battlements or firing ports make it easier for enemies to expect where you will pop up, easier to sight in, and harder for you to have a wide view of the battlefield. Visibility and mobility is key to using a bow effectively; you only need to build walls if you know where the enemy is and you are under fire. You should always try to be mobile as well; try moving unpredictably after shots.</li>
                </p>
                <p> 
                <li><strong>Fire at a high angle.</strong> Though this takes some practice, enemies behind cover can be sussed out by firing at a high arc—you don't pull back as much on the arrow and lob death from above. Following that theme, in a map like Sand Wars, a good tactic is to shoot up the floor with arrows; when the sand falls, the arrows dislodge themselves and you can sometimes get a lucky kill. This arrow-falling tactic also applies to blocks covered with arrows that are broken—this works really well for enemies tunneling under in Battle of Lyndannise: If you block up the hole that the enemies exit out of, and cover it in arrows, when the opponent breaks the block to attack you he will immediately be killed by the dislodged arrows. Furthermore, if you have really good timing, you can do the same on other maps like Race for Victory etc. Pillar up above the enemy, make a skypath, and shoot up a (optimally glass) block full of arrows. When an enemy races under you, you can break the block and drop a deadly arrow bomb from above.</li>
                </p>
                <p>
                <li><strong>Know your limits.</strong> Fully charged arrows do minimal damage to foes with full diamond armour, and take a long time to kill even iron armour, so sometimes shooting at them, especially when you're trying to sneak around, can arouse investigation in the area and give you away. However, even if they don't damage that much, they are good for holding enemies back at a range with their knockback. Furthermore, arrows are invaluable in dislodging opponents contstructing cannons, bridges, etc. and disrupting their activities. Arrow fire in general does produce a hesitant psychological effect on the enemy.</li>
                </p>
                <p>
                <li><strong>Play as a team.</strong> Seems like a no-brainer, but I see a lot of people not paying attention to who exactly they are shooting at and their significance–Always provide covering fire to people who are charging in to attack with a sword, and always take care to select vulnerable or high-value targets. Remember to make power shots when picking off unarmoured or exposed targets: jumping or sprinting forward while shooting a high-powered shot can give your arrow a boost. Always keep in mind that with every enemy you kill, you reduce their strength to attack your allies, so it's usually a better idea to kill three unarmoured aggressors, who will land some hits regardless of their survivability, than it is to try and wear down one heavily armoured foe.</li>
