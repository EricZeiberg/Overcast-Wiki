When playing on the Overcast Network, the average player, with no donation or moderation/administration perks, has access to the following commands:

/join //Allocates the player on a random team, exept if teams are full.
/report [player] [reason] // If you see someone breaking a rule (https://oc.tc/rules) use this command to notify Moderators and Administrators on what is happening! For more info click on this link: https://oc.tc/forums/topics/51cf6a48ba60877fea00482d
/lookup [player] // Shows all infractions a player has recieved.
/g [statement] // This command allows the player to write in global chat, meaning that any player or spectator can see what you are saying.
/msg [player] [msg] // This command allows two players to communicate privatley.

If a player has donated (https://oc.tc/shop), one has access to commands such as:

/join [team]

Additionally donators can join full teams, but only up to a 125% increase.

Moderators and Administrators have access to commands such as:

/setnext [map]
/kick [reason]
/tempban [time] [reason]
/ban [reason]
