Aim: The aim is to defend one’s own monument/s and at the same time break/destroy the enemy teams monument/s.

Objective: The objective of this gamemode is to reach the enemies side and go to their monument/s and break it. 

Maps: Most DTM maps consist of two monuments that are out of a few obsidian blocks. These obsidian blocks must be destroyed to win. Some maps in rotation, such as Corrupted Kingdoms consist of three monuments and a few such as Soviet Mills consist of one monument. Note that not every monument is limited to being out of obsidian, the monument on Soviet Mills is a big stonebrick object.

Positioning: In this gamemode players must choose if they want to be Offenders and break the monument, stay back as Mid-Fielders at the front lines and keep the enemy offenders back or act as Defenders and keep the monument from being broken. This is generally done by exposing the obsidian, placing buttons on the monument, or placing pressure plates underneath the monument.

Terminology: 

-Tunnelers: Players that mine their way until they reach the monument.
-Rushers: Players that rush to the enemy’s side right at the beginning of the match.
-DTM: Destroy The Monument.
