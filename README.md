## Editing Wiki

When you edit the wiki, you should (unless changing the backend portion), follow guidelines for keeping the format of the wiki the same on all pages. Please refer to the appropriate entry below for guidelines for the page you're editing.

- Gamemodes, PVP Tips, Tournaments
 - Adding a new entry
  - Add a tab, copy and paste the last one, and change the tab number & title.
  - Add a tab div, copy and paste the last one, and change the tab number & content.
 - Editing an old entry
  - Edit the title of the tab, and the content of the tab at your discretion, however unless explicitly needed do not edit the other parts of the html layout.
- Commands
 - Follow the guidelines for the above section, however with a few additions to formatting a page.
 - All commands you would run in game should be surrounded by `<kbd>/command</kbd>` even when not directly in the context of 'run this in game'
 - The div is formatted like this
```
<div class="col-md-9">
	<div class="page-header">
		<h1>/command <small>Description</small></h1>
	</div>
 <b>Usage:</b>
 <p><kbd>/command [parameter] [parameter...]</kbd></p>
 <b>Other info:</b>
 <p>Other information about the command, not required.</p>
</div>
```
- Ranks
 - Ranks are edited in `ranks.json`
 - Edit the file per the entries already there. If you add a new rank, its example should correspond to a screenshot in `/assets/img/ranks/Username.png`. This is case sensitive.
