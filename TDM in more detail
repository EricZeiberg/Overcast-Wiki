Aim: The aim is to kill as many enemies as possible in a given time, commonly 10 or 15 minutes, and have as little deaths as possible.

Objective: The objective is to have the most points when the timer hits 0. This is typically achieved by being the team with the more kills, though in certain maps such as BlockBlock, there is an additional scorebox in which one can score 5 points for ones team. 

Maps: At this point of time, it is only one team versus another, though 1v1v1v1’s have been introduced in the past. Typically a kill counts as 1 point and the entering of the score box, which is a lot harder, gives one 5 points. Each player generally spawns with a sword, some armor, a bow, some arrows and a way to regenerate health.

Positioning: Mostly it is a full on war, where each player tries to die as little as possible and kill as many players he/she can. Therefore there are no defenders, offenders etc. However if the map has a scorebox, there are Defenders who’s aim is to have as little enemies enter their scorebox
