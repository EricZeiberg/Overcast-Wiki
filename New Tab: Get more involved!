Have fun playing on the servers and talking to players ingame? There are many oppurtunities for a player to become a more active player in the community. For one you could read and discuss about suggestions, gameplay etc. on the forums: https://oc.tc/forums. Additionally you can start talking to other players who are interested in the servers on the oc.tc mumble. Mumble is a software that allows one to communicate with other players online, similair to skype. TO download the software go here: http://www.mumble.com. Once having downloaded and installed the software connect to the Adress: mumble.oc.tc, the Port is: 64738, and choose a username. Then just start having converations with other members. If verbal communication is not your thing you can always join the EsperNet IRC. This is basically a chat room where you can chat and ask questions to other players, moderators or even Admins! Click here to get to the login: http://www.esper.net/publicirc.php, choose a username, something related to your IGN and connect to the Channel: #OvercastNetwork. As you can see there are many ways to get involved and find new friends and every single on of them is worth it, so what are you waiting for?!
