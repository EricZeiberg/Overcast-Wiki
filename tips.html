      <h2>A general guide to PvP (Written by Oversoul96)</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>If youve played on Project Ares at all, youll know that there are tons of different strategies you can use in game play. In this guide, Ill talk about some tips and tricks I think will help players become more fit to survive in the PvP onslaught. This guide will focus mainly on DtC maps, because they are the most complex.</p>
      <h4><u>The Basics</u></h4>
      <p>You all know the drill, grab your gear and get into battle. Most of you will be able to skip over this section, as it will be very basic stuff, but lets dive right in anyway.</p>
      <h5>Getting Supplies</h5>
      <p>Hopefully all of you know this by now, but shift clicking items sends them straight into your inventory from chests. If you get to know the contents of each chest, you can grab all of your gear in less than 10 seconds. If youre a victim of TNT bombing rushers, youll want to get your supplies fast, because sitting at the chests for over a minute will just make you an easy target. </p>
      <p>The things you will most likely want to grab are tools. A pick, sword, axe, and bow should be the first things you grab, along with some building blocks, some TNT, and some arrows. Take some redstone torches or buttons if you want, but you can always make simple wood pressure plates later.</p>
      <p>No matter what youre doing, youre always going to want to have armor in the beginning of the game. Not only will it give you invulnerability to unarmored rushers, but it will also make you more effective in base defense. If you dont grab armor because of cannon construction or bow sniping, youre making a big mistake. </p>
      <h5>TNT</h5>
      <p>This is a huge part of DtC maps. Destroying the other teams supplies will give you a slight advantage in most maps, but setting off TNT will make you a big target for the enemy team. There are three main ways to blow up the enemy base: Cannons, direct assault, and bombing.</p>
      <p>Cannons are my personal favorite, though I rarely use them. They are very effective at doing damage when no direct path to the enemy base is available. There are many different cannon designs you can use, some more effective than others in certain situations.</p>
      <p>Direct assault is the most dangerous, but most effective way to destroy vital enemy supplies. Placing giant masses of TNT on the enemy base will do monstrous damage, with a high chance for kills. If you do this, it would help to have armor, or to do this at the very beginning of a match to catch the enemy off guard. </p>
      <p>TNT bombing is the last one on the list, but it is also the most cowardly tactic to use. Using a high vantage point above the enemy base, the player can endlessly rain TNT onto unsuspecting victims. This method of “carpet bombing” is looked down upon by most players of PGM, because most bombers spam TNT for kills. If you want to be a troll, go ahead and rain TNT on the spawn, but prepare to be yelled at. </p>
      <h4><u>Direct Combat</u></h4>
      <p>Anyone can swing a sword in this game, but learning to properly wield it is a different story. First off, lets talk about blocking.
</p>
      <h5>Blocking</h5>
      <p> For being a useful mechanic, blocking doesnt get enough love. Blocking can save your life in some events, but using it wrong can also be deadly. Before we get into things, lets make sure we know what blocking does. </p>
      <h6><em>Blocking does</em></h6>
      <p>-Reduce damage taken by melee attacks, arrows, and explosives. </p>
      <h6><em>Blocking does NOT</em></h6>
      <p>-Reduce falling, fire, or suffocation damage.</p>
      <p>The thing you might find yourself blocking most is arrows. Whipping out your sword will magically make you take less damage, and could even save your life. If youre cornered with an enemy pelting you with arrows, blocking would be a good idea. If there is an easy escape, running would obviously be the better choice.  </p>
      <p>Getting cornered with TNT in your face is also a good opportunity to block, but if you’re too close, you might just end up getting the floor blown out from underneath you. If youre on a base high in the sky, falling into the void from a TNT explosion would obviously be a bad thing.</p>
      <p>Another important tip for blocking TNT: If you have spare blocks on you, put them between you and the TNT, and you will only take a half heart of damage, no matter how close the explosion may be. If youre facing a monstrous TNT explosion, then the wall will not be very effective. </p>
      <p>Blocking is not very effective in melee combat, as it will make you slow and may even throw off your aim. Alternating between left and right click for your main attack is not something I would recommend, as it will end up doing less damage in the long run. </p>
      <h4><u>Sword Fighting</u></h4>
      <p>There are a number of ways to engage in close range combat, but a lot of these strategies will be useless if you have a bad connection to the server. </p>
      <h5>Strafing </h5>
      <p>One of the simplest ways to attack is in a circular pattern around your enemy. Rushing straight at your target is not smart. If you want to run straight at your target, youll want to jump to the side just before you attack. Having the speed boost of sprinting will give you an easier time in battle as well. </p>
      <h5>Jump Crits</h5>
      <p>I dont find these to be very useful, but starting off an attack with a jump can be advantageous. Just dont overdo the jumps, or they will probably throw off your momentum in a battle. </p>
      <h5>Knockback Launch</h5>
      <p>Being one of my favorite things to do, you will need a quick finger to pull this off. After every hit you land on an enemy, quickly double tap the forward key button and hit the enemy again to send him flying double the distance of a normal knockback. If youre really good, you can hit an enemy three times or more. Because of the slight delay you will have before the enemy goes flying, getting multiple strikes should be fairly simple.</p>
      <h5>Chasing</h5>
      <p>When chasing a fleeing enemy, do NOT spam your sword to try and hit him. All this will do is disable your sprint, because Minecraft will think youve struck an enemy while the enemy was actually too far away to take damage. Wait until youre close enough for a guaranteed hit before trying to attack.</p>
      <h5>Things you should not do in a sword fight </h5>
      <p>Running backwards and swinging your sword will let your enemy have an easier time hitting you, while he remains out of your reach (because thats just how this game works). Running away would be a better tactic than swinging while walking backwards.</p>
      <h4><u>Destroy the Core</u></h4>
      <p>Right here is where the fun begins. I will be showing you some of my own tactics, as well as other things I think will help you all for these maps. The main topics I will be discussing are the Core, Stealth, Bridging, and Speed. I will also tell you a few tricks for surviving in a losing battle.</p>
      <h5>The Core</h5>
      <p>This is your goal. Leaking lava from the core is simple enough, but we can make it even simpler. Most players see the bottom as the only option available for mining the core, but the most effective place to mine is usually near the top of the core. Look for these weak spots in the core, and youll be able to destroy it with ease. If the core has water underneath it, you can either lead the lava away from the water, or you can make a small + sign and cut out the center for the lava to leak through. </p>
      <p>If youre not attacking the core, the enemy base, or using a cannon, dont just stand around looking for things to shoot. Take a good look at the core every few seconds to make sure its safe. Playing without a plan will end up causing you to lose. And if youre trying to look for ways to barricade the core, dont do it. Barricading the core with blocks will make it a lot easier for hidden enemies to mine the core.</p>
      <h5>Stealth</h5>
      <p>Stealth is easily the biggest part of storming an enemy base. Rushing into a bunch of enemies looking for kills will not work. If you have a good vantage point, look for a break in the enemy defense to make your attack. Make sure youre always crouching, too. Dont ever assume that youre perfectly safe, because someone might catch a glimpse of you. Done correctly, you can easily get to your objective without being spotted. </p>
      <p>As for hiding places, creating a box around your self is usually a lot more effective than it sounds. Just dont make it in the middle of the base, or it will look suspicious. Also, remember that you can always make more area for you to walk around on. Dig inside of a wall if you need to, and dig to vulnerable parts of the base through there. You can even line the inside of a base with TNT and ignite it completely undetected. Dont just run across an open field covering the ground with TNT </p>
      <h5>Bridging</h5>
      <p>Bridging is simple, but if you dont want to die while doing it, there are a few things you can do. </p>
      <p>Quick bridging is, as it sounds, the fastest way to directly bridge to an enemy base, but it also puts you in the most vulnerable position. </p>
      <p>If you take a look at this picture  </p> 
      <img src="http://i49.tinypic.com/2a4xod2.png" class="img-rounded">
      <p>While bridging from the red ship to the blue ship, you will want to stand on the side that the green arrow is on, because most archers will be striking you from the left part of the blue ship, sending you to the right. If youre standing on the left, the knockback shouldnt be enough to send you flying off in one hit.</p>
      <p>Making a bridge with rails is slower, but is also safer. Make sure you place the railing blocks before you place the actual bridge, so that youll always have a railing. You shouldnt get knocked backwards toward the void, so making the railing first will give you a better chance to live a shot from an enemy. </p>
      <p>If you want to retreat from a bridge, stay on the side that is opposite from the knockbacks you are receiving, as told before. Also, do NOT jump while sprinting, or the knockback will be greater than usual, and will surely knock you off of a bridge. </p>
      <h5>Speed</h5>
      <p>The last thing I want to talk about, but it is still fairly simple. As all of you should know, jumping while sprinting makes you faster, but another thing I want to talk about is sprint-jump boosting. </p>
      <p>Sprint-jump boosting is an easy way to outrun an enemy in an area that is two blocks high. If you repeatedly jump against the two-high ceiling while sprinting, you can gain a huge speed boost. </p>
      <h5>What to do in a losing battle</h5>
      <p>If you're out of supplies, you might think you're screwed. The first thing you'll want to do is look around your base for any stray items from a dead player. Usually any amount of supplies should be enough to get you back on your feet.</p>
      <p>Out of picks? Grab a TNT. TNT can easily be ignited with a pressure plate, made of only two wood. Place a TNT on one of your diamond or iron patches to get easy access to tools and armor.</p>
      <p>Is there a bridge? Run to the enemy base and steal some supplies from them. If it's late enough in the game for you to be out of supplies, then stealthily taking supplies from the enemy base should be simple while everyone is in disarray.</p>
      <p>The most important thing to do is never give up. You can always come back and win, no matter how bad it gets.</p>
