Aim: The aim is to leak the enemy’s obsidian core and keep ones own untouched.

Objective: The objective is to break the obsidian core and have the lava leak out. 15 minutes into the game, the obsidian material changes to gold, making the breaking of it easier. After 20 minutes the gold core will change into glass.

Maps: Most DTC maps only have one core, though a few have two such as Inheritance, Battle of Tenjin 2 or Total War. 

Positioning: Typically there are three different positions a player can play. The Rusher will aim to leak the core and have the lava flow out of it. Midfielders will try and hold no-mans-land for their team and the Defenders aim is to keep their core from leaking at all cost, this is typically done by covering the core with lava, making the leaking of the core a lot harder. 


Terminology: 

-Tunnelers: Players that mine their way through the enemy lanes in order to reach the wool room. 
-Rushers: Players that rush to the enemy’s side right at the beginning of the match.
